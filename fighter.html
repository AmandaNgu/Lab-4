                             which is often juxtaposed against the light-hearted, fiery persona of his childhood friend, Ken.
                              He wanders the world with the desire for complete mastery of his martial art, and takes both his travels and 
                              training seriously. For Ryu, the training and the mastery that comes from the fight are all that he requires for
                               satisfaction, declining the more material trappings of his various accomplishments as a warrior, simply moving on to his next challenge once he is victorious without delay,
                                unless he is offered food or if he wants to converse with his friendly rivals.</td>

                             Zangief is an incredibly patriotic character who has been motivated in some way to fight for his
                              Russian motherland in every single game he has ever been in. While his personality has varied from one 
                              media source to another, Zangief is mostly been portrayed as a very fearless and tactical fighter who is 
                              prone to quick temperaments and is always very competitive. In addition to being overwhelmingly patriotic,
                               he is immensely proud of his massive physique and is obsessed with muscle building. In battles, he 
                               constantly belittles his opponent's smaller muscular build and blaming their losses on their lack of 
                               muscular power. His win quotes often consists of critiques towards his specific opponents about their 
                               lack of power or him telling his opponents to build more muscle.</td>

                              She states that power is nothing without skill and that she must continue on her path, even if it means
                               to give up her life for the greater good.

                        <td>Karin's laugh and mannerisms are derived from the unpleasant "ojou" stereotypes common in anime and manga as well as the
                             "rich person"/"popular schoolgirl"/"spoiled brat"/"wealthy aristocrat" stereotypes of Western fiction;
                             while she typically remains snobbish and haughty as per the standard, other aspects of her personality can vary 
                             wildly in other media. In Namco x Capcom, Karin is calmer, more level-headed and cynical, 
                             and serves as the voice of reason for the impulsive Sakura (though she still retains her trademark laugh and
                              condescending comments during battle sequences). In the UDON comics, on the other hand, 
                             she is extremely hateful and competitive to the point of obsessiveness, making her much more of an antagonist. 
                            Throughout the franchise, she does retain her mannerisms and snobbiness and a habit of acting before thinking.
